      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          My name is Blake Pearsall and I currently in school to learn how to become a web developer learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
          My hope after this program is to be able to land a job in web development that will give me the freedom to move around and the
          opportunity to be able to learn additional languages in order to build my personal resume up to become a full-stack developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to coding, I had held jobs in various different fields, including but not limited to home repair and construction, food service, and front office work.
          Much of my adult life has been figuring out what exactly I want my professional career to be. The one major thing I have been chasing is a profession that allows
          me to grow and develop throughout my entire professional career. And I believe that coding offers that kind of professional development.
          It is already clear to me in this short time I've been in the Rutgers Coding Bootcame that there is an incredible berth of knowledge simply in HTML and CSS
